Orthopedic Research activities involve writing IRB proposals, abstracts, and final manuscripts, performing chart review, statistical analysis, and measurement of various metrics on radiographic imaging as well as engaging in patient interaction/ultrasound use.  Research interests are broad across subsepcialities of orthopedics, and range from involvement with clinical trials to database studies to retrospective chart reviews.
